## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

### Added

- `localpost.http.thread_pool_handler` — async context manager that wraps
  any `RequestHandler` so it runs on a worker thread. Compose explicitly
  with `http_server` when you need a worker pool; immediate handlers
  (including a `Router`'s 404/405 path) stay on the selector thread.

### Changed

- `localpost.http._service.http_server` no longer accepts `max_concurrency`
  and no longer owns a worker pool. Wrap your handler with
  `thread_pool_handler` to opt back into worker dispatch.
- `localpost.http.flask.flask_server` and `localpost.http.wsgi_server`
  drop their `max_concurrency` kwarg for the same reason — wrap with
  `thread_pool_handler` if you need a pool (typical for blocking WSGI
  / Flask apps).
